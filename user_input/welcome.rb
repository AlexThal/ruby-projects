# Make a function that gets the user name and prints a greeting to him
# But only welcomes Alice and Bob
# ex. welcome('Alex') -> Prints "Hi, Alex."
# ex. welcome('Alice') -> Prints "Welcome, Alice!"
def welcome(user)

# Make a program that uses the welcome function and keeps greeting everyone until it welcomes someone
# Hint: the function can return something to indicate if it welcomed or just greeted someone.
